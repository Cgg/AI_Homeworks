What does your method do?
My method uses alpha beta pruning, storing a board state at a given
node. To expand the tree, I generate every possible move from the current
node and generate corresponding boards (ie nodes).
As a heuristic, I take into account my amount of men/kings and the one of
the ennemy. Board's squares are also weighted, with a set for the men and
another one for the kings, which allows me to "push" my men toward the end
of the board (to crown them), and then to "pull" my kings back toward me.
I also use iterative deepening for my alpha beta search, which allows me to
take fully advantage of my 10 sec timeslot (average reached depth is about
10 on my netbook).

If your method was allowed an infite amount of time to make each move, would it be impossible to defeat it?
Since I use a reasonnable heuristic, my method could at least not lose,
depending on how the opponent is playing. But it would indeed take a very
large amount of time.
